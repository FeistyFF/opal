<p> You that hissing has been your habit while am talking or when I asked you to repeat spoken sentences, you turn your head sideway to murmur with your hearing counterparts for me not to read your lips to know what you are communicating, you just don’t want me talking/asking, you trying to trample on my freedom of expression/you are jealous of my God-given talent which is an hindrance for you to take me for granted just because am Deaf, the only moment I enjoy your listening heart is when you come to me for assistance, am gonna advice you like ‘kilode’. 
<br>
Firstly, go read on my site,www.fffadvocacybase.blogspot.com to eliminate your ignorance and secondly, remember, I was once hearing like you, situation can change at any moment in life, the point is, you are taking God for granted for acting in such a way towards me His creature, you should be happy/cheerful to make the Deaf have the knowledge of what’s going on in his/her environment and in return, you will enjoy God’s favour, its because you never had the experience of hearing loss, if you had, you will know what it takes, rather to be thanking God for still preserving parts of your body, you are mocking  and trying to take me for granted. Do you think its easy to be listening through the eyes? OMG!
<br>
Kosi wahala (no problem), each time you see me smiling in return, you should know that, inwardly, am praying to God, discussing with Him concerning you taking Him for granted, to make you loose your hearing towards glorifying Himself as He has the power to give and to take, or one of your children become Deaf to make you have a taste of what my parent went through when I lost my hearing. 
I will happily welcome you to the Deaf community once that happened. 
<br>
Am not wishing you evil, ‘afowofa e ni’ (its what you bargained for). My Deafness is for a purpose while yours will be without purpose.
Be warned!
